# Advent of Code 2023

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

Continuing in Go. However, doing this without the use of any code assistant. Will be weird at first.

Note to self. I actually do not have much time this year to dedicate to this. That's the reason I'm going with a familiar language. Nevertheless - I suspect this will go on long after the actual event is over.

```bash
for folder in $(find ./ -name 'day*' -type d); do cd $folder && go test && go run . && cd ..; done
```

## Day 01

Nothing out of the ordinary for the first day. Just a pesky itsy-bitsy off-by one :)

## Day 02

Easy peasy.

## Day 03

Part 2 caught me a bit off-guard. After short deliberations with a person as non-programmer as me (that being myself) decided to go ad-hoc for the secodn part.

## Day 04

First part was trivial, second - easy enough once you read all the requirements. I feel that there was some fancy algorithm intended to be used here, but I'll leave it to those who feel them.
